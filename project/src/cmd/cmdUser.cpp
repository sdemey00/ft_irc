#include "CmdDispatch.hpp"

// Command: USER
//    Parameters: <username> <hostname> <servername> <realname>

// void    cmdUser(IRCCore& core, User& user, const Message& msg) {}

//    The USER message is used at the beginning of connection to specify
//    the username, hostname, servername and realname of s new user.  It is
//    also used in communication between servers to indicate new user
//    arriving on IRC, since only after both USER and NICK have been
//    received from a client does a user become registered.

//    Between servers USER must to be prefixed with client's NICKname.
//    Note that hostname and servername are normally ignored by the IRC
//    server when the USER command comes from a directly connected client
//    (for security reasons), but they are used in server to server
//    communication.  This means that a NICK must always be sent to a
//    remote server when a new user is being introduced to the rest of the
//    network before the accompanying USER is sent.

//    It must be noted that realname parameter must be the last parameter,
//    because it may contain space characters and must be prefixed with a
//    colon (':') to make sure this is recognised as such.

//    Since it is easy for a client to lie about its username by relying
//    solely on the USER message, the use of an "Identity Server" is
//    recommended.  If the host which a user connects from has such a
//    server enabled the username is set to that as in the reply from the
//    "Identity Server".

//    Numeric Replies:
//            ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS              ERR_ALREADYREGISTRED

//    Examples:
//    USER guest tolmoon tolsun :Ronnie Reagan
//                                    ; User registering themselves with a
//                                    username of "guest" and real name
//                                    "Ronnie Reagan".

//    :testnick USER guest tolmoon tolsun :Ronnie Reagan
//                                    ; message between servers with the
//                                    nickname for which the USER command
//                                    belongs to
